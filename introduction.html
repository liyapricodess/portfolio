  <!--paragraph is a short, creative description
  of myself as a potential front-end developer-->
  <p>I'm a creative and passionate front-end developer. 
    Every line of code is a step toward making 
    something beautiful and interactive, and seeing 
    a design transform into a working feature never 
    gets old. Itâ€™s this dynamic, ever-evolving nature 
    of front end work that keeps me inspired and 
    excited to learn more.</p>
